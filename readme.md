# Usage
We use [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) to extract image features and corresponding top3 semantic labels. You can download the image features we processed from [Google Drive]().

To run the code, you need to first change the parameter **--img_path** as your save path after downloading.
